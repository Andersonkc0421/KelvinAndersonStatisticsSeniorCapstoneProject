# Statistical techniques are broadly popular in sports and used for predicting the likelihood of winning for a specific player. In this work, two statitical methods, logistic regression and data mining are used to predict the match outcome of Rafael Nadal playing in the tennis grand slam tournamemts from 2010-2020 based on data from 210 matches. In logistic regression, starting with seven independent variables, a statistically significant model for Nadal's winning probability is developed in terms of the two predictors, ace and break points saved, utilizing a training set of size 147 (70\% of 2010) and test set of size 63 matches, leaving a goodness-of-fit $p$-value $=0.6085$ for the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. In data mining, classification helped identify most relevant predictors while anomaly detection helped giude identifying extreme data values. The proposed model is simple and appealing on predicting the probability of winning a tennis match played by Rafael Nadal in any of the future grand slam tournaments.
